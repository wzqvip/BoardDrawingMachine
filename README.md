# BoardDrawingMachine

 BoardDrawingMachine, Currently trying to paint something on to *GeekPie Whiteboard*


Materials :

* Arduino Nano (mega328p old bootloader)
* 28BYJ4+ULN2003 stepper motor
* SG90/MG90S 9g Servo
* Arduino nano shield (optional, but suggested for comfort)
* Power Supply (5/12V are both fine, The stepper accpet both of them. Be cautious when you connect them, and remember to give the stepper direct power supply(It consumes a lot power) if you use 12V, do not use the 5V on Arduino.)
* Wires and wires.
